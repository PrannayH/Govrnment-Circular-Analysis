# Document Processing and Analysis Project

This project involves processing and analyzing documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and graph databases. The core components include data annotation, model training, OCR extraction, NER processing, and storing data in a Neo4j graph database.

## Project Components

### 1. Annotation
- *Description:* Annotating data involves labeling text in documents to train models for tasks like Named Entity Recognition.
- *Tools Used:* SpaCy for creating and managing annotations.
- *Why:* Accurate annotations are crucial for training effective NER models. The annotations help in recognizing entities and understanding the context within the text.

### 2. Training
- *Description:* Training machine learning models using annotated data to perform NER.
- *Tools Used:* TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for model development.
- *Why:* These frameworks provide robust tools for building and training deep learning models, crucial for achieving high accuracy in NER tasks.

### 3. OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- *Description:* Extracting text from images or PDFs using OCR technology.
- *Tools Used:* Tesseract OCR.
- *Why:* Tesseract helps in converting scanned or image-based text into machine-readable text, which is essential for processing documents that are not in a text format.

### 4. NER (Named Entity Recognition)
- *Description:* Identifying and classifying entities within text.
- *Tools Used:* SpaCy for performing NER tasks.
- *Why:* NER helps in extracting meaningful entities from text, such as names, dates, and organizations, which are crucial for understanding and organizing document content.

### 5. Neo4j (Graph Database)
- *Description:* Storing and querying relationships between entities in a graph database.
- *Tools Used:* Neo4j.
- *Why:* Neo4j efficiently manages and queries complex relationships, which is essential for analyzing connections between different parts of the document data.
